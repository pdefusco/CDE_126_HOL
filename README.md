# CDE 1.26 Hands On Lab

![alt text](/img/new-ref-arch.png)

## About the CDE Lab

In these Labs you will gain hands-on experience with the Cloudera Data Engineering Service. You will:

1. Develop a PySpark and Iceberg Application connecting to a Spark Virtual Cluster via Spark Connect using the JupyterLab IDE.
2. Prototype your Spark Application in a dedicated CDE DEV environment.
3. Use git to back up your code and push it to a dedicated CDE PRD environment.
4. Create an Airflow Pipeline to orchestrate multiple Spark Applications.
5. Monitor your Spark Applications with CDP Observability and the CDP Data Catalog.

## About the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Service

CDE is the Cloudera Data Engineering Service, a containerized managed service for Cloudera Data Platform designed for Large Scale Batch Pipelines with Spark, Airflow and Iceberg. It allows you to submit batch jobs to auto-scaling virtual clusters. As a Cloud-Native service, CDE enables you to spend more time on your applications, and less time on infrastructure.

CDE allows you to create, manage, and schedule Apache Spark jobs without the overhead of creating and maintaining Spark clusters. With CDE, you define virtual clusters with a range of CPU and memory resources, and the cluster scales up and down as needed to run your Spark workloads, helping to control your cloud costs.

## Versions

The labs target CDE 1.26.1 with Spark 3.5.4, Python 3.11, Iceberg 1.5.2 and Airflow 2.11.2.

## Participant Environment

Participants run the CDE CLI and Spark Connect from a JupyterLab IDE. Use one of:

* **Local Docker:** `docker run -p 8888:8888 pauldefusco/cde_126_hol`, then open the JupyterLab URL printed in the terminal.
* **EC2 instance:** provided by the HOL lead, with or without Docker. See the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL/blob/main/setup/README.md#4-participant-ide-environment).

## Step by Step Instructions

Detailed instructions are provided in the [step_by_step_guides](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL/tree/main/step_by_step_guides/english).

## Setup Instructions

The HOL requires data and CDE dependencies (e.g. shared Files and Python Resources) to be created before the event. The attached [Setup Guide](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL/blob/main/setup/README.md) provides instructions for completing these requirements.
