## Objective

In this section you will learn how to monitor, troubleshoot and improve your Spark applications following insights provided by Cloudera Observability.

## Table of Contents

1. [Spark Application Development](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL/blob/main/step_by_step_guides/english/02-development.md#lab-1-spark-application-development).  
2. [CDE Repositories, Jobs, and Monitoring](https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL/blob/main/step_by_step_guides/english/02-development.md#lab-2-cde-repositories-jobs-and-monitoring).

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Observability UI and troubleshoot the pipeline.

In the Observability UI, locate your CDP Environment and drill down to your CDE Virtual Cluster expanding the tabs on the left side. In these screenshots the CDE Virtual Cluster is called "DEV". The click on "Spark" to land into the main Spark view.

Scroll to the bottom right and notice your underperforming job runs are automatically flagged and categorized by warning type.

Click on any of the job runs and explore the Overview tab. This is where all your insights for a particular run are summarized. Notice all warnings for this particular run are shown, in this example "Shuffle Task Input Skew".

Open the "Health Checks" tab and investigate each of the stages flagged as anomalous. Notice on the right side a description of the flagged anomaly and a recommendation for fixing it are presented to you.

You can drill down further into the issue. Click on one of the flagged stages and review the Task Details view on the right side. A comparison with a baseline task is automatically shown for you. This indicates the particular Spark metrics that are anomalous when compared to the baseline.

Expand the Baseline tab for a more refined comparison of Spark Metrics between the anomalous run and the baseline.

Navigate back to the main Jobs view and notice all runs are shown along with any potential Health Issues.

Finally open the Trends tab and notice aggregate runtime metrics are shown. Cloudera Observability has automatically tracked every run of the Spark Application in question to monitor performance across time.
