# Spark Application Development in CDE

![alt text](../../img/spark-connect-slide.png)

## Objective

In this section you will learn how to interact with the CDE Virtual Cluster via CDE Sessions and Spark Connect in order to develop Spark Applications on a daily basis.

You will also use the CDE CLI to run more advanced functions such as monitoring job status and working with CDE Repositories to migrate and sync code with external git repositories.

## Lab 1. Spark Application Development

In the JupyterLab terminal, run the following commands to install the CDE Spark Connect tarballs.

```
pip3 install cdeconnect.tar.gz  
pip3 install pyspark-3.5.4.tar.gz
```

#### Launch a CDE Spark Connect Session

Spark Connect lets your notebook hold a lightweight, decoupled connection to a remote Spark runtime, so you get the responsiveness of local development—editing, running cells, and inspecting results in real time—while the heavy computation runs on the cluster.

Start a CDE Session of type Spark Connect. Edit the Session Name parameter so it doesn't collide with other users' sessions. You will be prompted for your Workload Password. This is the same password you used to log into CDP.

```
cde session create \
  --name user001-hol-session \
  --type spark-connect \
  --num-executors 2 \
  --driver-cores 2 \
  --driver-memory "2g" \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --executor-memory "2g"
```

In the Sessions UI, validate the Session is Running.

#### Run Your First PySpark & Iceberg Application via Spark Connect

You are now ready to connect to the CDE Session from your local JupyterLab IDE using Spark Connect.

Open Iceberg_TimeTravel_PySpark_banking.ipynb. Update the Spark Connect session name, the username and the Storage Location variables in the first two cells. Then run each cell in the notebook.

```
from cde import CDESparkConnectSession
spark = CDESparkConnectSession.builder.sessionName('<your-spark-connect-session-name-here>').get()
```

```
storageLocation = <your-storage-location-here>
username = <your-cdp-workload-username-here>
```

#### Prototype the Spark & Iceberg Application as a Spark Submit

Once an application is validated interactively, the same code can be promoted to a production-grade CDE job—using the CDE CLI to package resources, create the job, and run it on a Virtual Cluster on a schedule or on demand.

On your terminal run the following commands to run your code as a Spark Submit. Make sure to edit the "vcluster-ednpoint" option according to your Virtual Cluster's Jobs API URL.

```
cde spark submit \
  pyspark-app.py \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here> \
  --executor-memory "4g" \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  <your-storage-location-here> \
  <your-hol-username-here>
```

For example:

```
cde spark submit \
  pyspark-app.py \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT \
  --executor-memory "4g" \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  s3a://pdf101126-buk-b8415038/data/cde-126-hol/bank/20261014 \
  user001
```

Wait for the application to run and validate results in the terminal.

You are now ready to convert the Spark Submit into a CDE Spark Job.

## Lab 2. CDE Repositories, Jobs, and Monitoring

CDE Repositories are used to import files and dependencies into Virtual Clusters by cloning git repositories. Create your CDE Repository and sync it with the Git Repository. Make sure to update the name and vcluster-endpoint parameters before executing the CLI commands.

```
cde repository create --name sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --branch main \
  --url https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL.git \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

```
cde repository sync --name sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

For example:

```
cde repository create --name sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --branch main \
  --url https://github.com/pdefusco/CDE_126_HOL.git \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

```
cde repository sync --name sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

#### Deploy using CLI

Now create a CDE Spark job using the CDE Repository as a dependency. The files in the Repository are mounted and reachable by the Application at runtime.

Before executing the CLI commands, update the name, resource, and vcluster endpoint options according to your assigned username.

```
cde job create --name cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001 \
  --type spark \
  --mount-1-resource sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --executor-memory "4g" \
  --application-file pyspark-app.py\
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here> \
  --arg <your-storage-location-here> \
  --arg <your-hol-username-here>
```

```
cde job run --name cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001 \
  --executor-cores 4 \
  --executor-memory "2g" \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

For example:

```
cde job create --name cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001 \
  --type spark \
  --mount-1-resource sparkAppRepoDevUser001 \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --executor-memory "4g" \
  --application-file pyspark-app.py\
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT \
  --arg s3a://pdf101126-buk-b8415038/data/cde-126-hol/bank/20261014 \
  --arg user001
```

```
cde job run --name cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001 \
  --executor-cores 4 \
  --executor-memory "2g" \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

####  Monitor

Navigate to the Job Runs UI / run a few CDE CLI commands to check status.

```
# List all Jobs in the Virtual Cluster:
cde job list \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

For example:

```
# List all Jobs in the Virtual Cluster:
cde job list \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

![alt text](../../img/cde-job-list-1.png)

```
# List all jobs in the Virtual Cluster whose name is "cde_spark_job_user001":
cde job list \
  --filter 'name[eq]cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001' \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

```
# List all jobs in the Virtual Cluster whose job application file name equals "pyspark-app.py":
cde job list \
  --filter 'spark.file[eq]pyspark-app.py' \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

For example:

```
# List all jobs in the Virtual Cluster whose name is "cde_spark_job_user001":
cde job list \
  --filter 'name[eq]cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001' \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

```
# List all jobs in the Virtual Cluster whose job application file name equals "pyspark-app.py":
cde job list \
  --filter 'spark.file[eq]pyspark-app.py' \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

![alt text](../../img/cde-job-list-2.png)

```
# List all runs for Job "cde_spark_job_user001":
cde run list \
  --filter 'job[eq]cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001' \
  --vcluster-endpoint <your-DEV-vc-jobs-api-url-here>
```

For example:

```
# List all runs for Job "cde_spark_job_user001":
cde run list \
  --filter 'job[eq]cde_spark_iceberg_job_user001' \
  --vcluster-endpoint $DEV_VCLUSTER_ENDPOINT
```

## Lab 3. Using the Claude CLI with CDE Spark Connect

Pairing the Claude CLI (Claude Code) with Spark Connect creates a fast, interactive development loop right inside a local IDE. By acting as an AI pair programmer, Claude can scaffold PySpark code, build Iceberg notebooks, explain DataFrame logic, debug errors, and refine transformations conversationally, all without leaving your editor.

Because Claude is a general-purpose assistant, its usefulness extends well beyond Spark: it can help write documentation, automate CLI and shell tasks, generate test data, answer technical questions, draft and review code in any language, and orchestrate broader engineering work—making it a versatile companion across the entire development lifecycle.

#### Requirements

In order to complete this lab you need a Claude account. You can sign up at http://www.claude.com or use an account provided by your Cloudera Lab lead.

#### Setup

Install the JupyterAI extension. In the terminal, run:

```
pip install jupyter-ai
```

Next, install Claude with:

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Finally, add it to your path:
Ask your instructor for API Key
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
#echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-CVKxxxxxx-xxxxx-ThA0QAA"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Run the Claude CLI:

```
claude
```

![alt text](../../img/claude-13.png)


Option 1 : Yes, I trust this folder


And then use API key


![alt text](../../img/claude-11.png)


You are now in Claude's CLI prompt. 

![alt text](../../img/claude-12.png)

As a test, ask it to "Explain the CDE CLI"

```
Explain the CDE CLI.
```

The output in your screen should look similar to this:

![alt text](../../img/claude-2.png)

Next, use Claude to generate a new PySpark / Iceberg notebook:

```
Generate a Jupyter Notebook similar to "Iceberg Time Travel PySpark Banking" but use features such as Iceberg partition evolution and schema evolution.
```

## Summary and Next Steps

A Spark Connect Session is a type of CDE Session that exposes the Spark Connect interface. A Spark Connect Session allows you to connect to Spark from any remote Python environment.

Spark Connect allows you to connect remotely to the Spark clusters. Spark Connect is an API that uses the DataFrame API and unresolved logical plans as the protocol.

In this section of the labs we reviewed an end to end developer framework using Spark Connect, the CDE CLI, and Apache Iceberg.
